# Grid Map Editor
## Changes the code so that it will compile 

Made some changes that the code will compile and will start with UE5.6
* Fair Warning:  This is a C++ plugin for UE5.6


## Original Comment:
### DROPPING SUPPORT FOR THIS BECAUSE UE5'S MODELLING TOOLS ARE MUCH BETTER
* Fair Warning:  This is a C++ plugin for UE4

This is still very work in progress, but feel free to check it out.
